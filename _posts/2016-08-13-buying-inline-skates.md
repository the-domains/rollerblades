**Buying Inline Skates**

**Skating Styles **

One of the most challenging parts of getting used to inline skating is the wide selection of choices on the market for you to make the most of. Typically, you'll find that starting here is going to be an easy way to understand, appreciate and make the most of the style that you want to pick up.

**Recreational Styles**

The main kinds of skates tend to be both Recreational, and Fitness. These are commonly used to help you manage various tasks and can be really easy to pick up in the right fit, if you know what to look out for.

Inline skates usually follow the same kind of sizing style as your regular shoe size -- however, they can be half a size smaller at times. When looking for either Fitness or Recreational styles, the fit is going to be of major importance. 

Sizing problems are a common issue, and this can mean that you spend a lot of time trying them on and never getting the true fit. The best test for fitting is to try on the skate, then kick back in the heel before tying it tightly. This will help you see just how much room you have inside to move your feet around.

Also, like normal shoes, these will become easier and more comfortable to wear after time goes on. They can change by as much as half a shoe size again, so failing to accommodate for "breaking in" the shoes can be a mistake.

**Fitting for Hockey**

Another issue when it comes to fitting is finding the fit for a hockey player. Inline hockey skates should feel nice and snug, but not tight to the point of being sore. Usually anything from half a size to two sizes smaller than normal shoes can be a good place to start. Given that some kids wear shoes as much as 2 sizes too big in the first place to allow for growth, it can be very easy to grow into the right fit.

Remember that it takes around 10 outings before a skate is fully broken in, so the adjustment period can be quite arduous. 

**Fitting for Kids**

Children are obviously different to adults as they are still growing, and this can make finding inline skates for kids' tough work. Most styles can be found in adjustable sizes, meaning that they can be anything from 2-4 sizes different with adjustment. This allows you to make sure that your skates for kids are going to last longer, meaning you aren't investing in a new pair for the kids every few weeks. 

Again, it can take up to ten wears for the skates to be fully broken in; you can then use that adjustment process to ensure your kids get the best style and fit.

**Determining the Fit**

A significant factor that comes from determining the right fit, though, is making sure that you take the time to look for the ideal skate to begin with. Many people make a rushed decision and find they no longer are as comfortable in the skates as they assumed that they would be. 

If you want to avoid that problem, make sure that your toes are barely touching the front of the toe box. This means your ankle should sit in the location with the right padding, meaning that your whole foot is getting the support that it needs.

Improving your foot fitting can be tough, but if you intend to do so we recommend trying the following;

\*

Go to an Aftermarket Footbed. These are a form of footbeds that sit in the actual shoe and offers a better level of comfort in the boots you already own. They help to add better support for the arches of the foot and also just general extra support for your feet as you skate, giving you greater comfort in the shoe.

\*

Alternatively, you could go out and buy some specific performance socks. There are skating socks available in stores and online that are made to give you a better form of comfort in the sock. It will be thinner than a normal sock, improving the chances of your feet being able to properly breathe. 

\*

It's the little things that make all the difference for most skaters. There is no guide that you can follow, though, that will tell you 100% what works for you. Nobody has the same feet as you and thus you have to look at various brands, styles, extras and accessories to find the best combination for you.

Just because one set is a poor fit today does not mean that
they next set is going to be. Trial and error means you will spend some time
adjusting to find the perfect set, but it's worth persevering. 

**Sizing Inline Skates**

If you want to make sure that your feet and your body in general is getting the right level of support and assistance, then it pays to understand the process of accurately sizing inline skates. So, make sure you read this part over before you start buying!

\*

If you intend on going down a classic route and using Rollerblade brand skates, you should find it easy to get a good fit. They are very similar in size to a normal shoe so if you tend to wear running shoes which are a size 9, then you should find that a size 9 Rollerblade will be close to what you need. Sometimes, even just half a size in change can be enough to help your feet breathe accordingly. 

\*

K2 skates are another popular brand, and they are also very similar to your normal shoe sizes. If you want to make the most of your feet then turning to the same size that you wear for everyday shoes will be a good idea. Sometimes, again, it can be a half-size change that you need. They are also somewhat narrower than a Rollerblade shoe so you should take the time to investigate that part of the shoe before buying any.

\*

Roces are another good brand to look into and they will typically be quite different from a normal shoe. They are usually a fair bit smaller so if you tend to get into a size 9 shoe, go for a size 9.5 or even a 10\. The difference is quite significant so don't just settle or wing it -- Roces are never very comfortable when you try and "squeeze" in.

**Managing the Width**

We touched upon briefly the importance of having good width in your skates when you start using them. This is so important and will play a major role in determining how comfortable you feel when skating. Many people find that the standard D width of a skate is not enough for them, but unfortunately this is as wide as you are likely to find at this moment in time.

Going just half a size larger, though, can help to avoid this problem and make your feet feel more comfortable. A little extra room in the shoe can give you more heel room, alleviating pressure from the skates being too narrow. The other suggestion that you can use this is to buy a more expensive brand of skate -- they tend to have stronger interior elements, making it easier for your foot to feel more secure in the shape of the shoe itself. 

This means that more expensive skates will tend to have a snugger when you're wearing them out.
