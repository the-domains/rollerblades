**Kinds of Inline Skates **

For anyone thinking of getting into inline skating, one of the most important elements of your decision making process should be buying the right kinds of skates. You may think that inline skating means throwing on any old pair of skates and bouncing off to have fun -- sadly, it's not that simple!

The variety of inline skate styles meaning working until you find a style that you feel is most suitable to where you wish to be. Among the various forms that exist you will find the likes of **recreational skates**, **fitness skates**, **roller hockey skates**, and **aggressive skates**.

Each style has its own formt and way of working. If you don't know what kind of skate is going to be most beneficial to you, or what suits your desires, then we can help you make that choice with ease!

**Recreational Inline Skates**

Recreational styles are the most common form and are the style people use for having fun with. These are designed to be used as the kind that you go just go out and enjoy most forms of inline skating with. The "strap on and use" style comes from recreational inline skates. They cud be used anywhere from your local street to a bike trail. They are the most versatile and can give you various styles to pick from, with most manufacturers having at least one recreational set.

Skate materials and other features like how they close up will vary depending on the model that you pick from. However, they also tend to have a soft-boot style mostly and are constructed using either mesh or cloth with hard plastic solidifying the booth itself.

They also close differently, using anything from standard lacing to power assisted systems.

**Fitness Inline Skating**

One form of skates is for those who want to get into shape quickly and easily. These skates were designed for hockey players to train with, but over the years they have become perfect for those who want to get in shape in general. These are higher performance than the above option, and are likely to make sure you get a more effective training experience. In terms of the design, though, they tend to follow the same patterns as the recreational sets.

Variances will exist, with everything from wheel size and overall weight changing, but the layout tends to stay the same. The major difference is in wheel size, mainly. The overall skate weight is brought down on fitness skates to make sure you can get around and feel more comfortable using them. 

Given the low wear and tear of using skating to get fit, this can be a far more suitable option for getting into shape than using, say, jogging or running.

**Roller-Hockey Inline Skating**

The next selection is going to be for roller-hockey programs. They are, as you may have imagined, designed for use with hockey. As a sport that is growing all the time, these specific shoes will make the perfect ally for those who are getting into the sport and want the right equipment for playing in.

The reason they even exist is because hockey players wanted to train and get in shape even when they had no ice to train on. This was the beginning of this kind of skate, allowing for a sport to be born from it in the first place!

The fast paced nature of the game means that these skates tend to follow the same pattern. They have a very high energy style that makes it easy to move around in. The skates obviously take their design inspirations from their genesis, ice hockey skates. The boots tend to be made from leather with high-end stitching, making use of various materials like carbon fiber or even plastic to enhance the quality of the boot. 

If you have played ice hockey before, these will feel familiar!

**Racing Inline Skating**

This is another form of skate that is very popular, and is designed for those who want to get competitive. Racing skates offer the finest value between speed and durability, meaning they can be used long-term to help you get used to racing in this kind of product. The design is simple -- they are very minimal, meaning that you can go as fast as you like with them. If you want to go for a scenic stroll, then this is not the option for you.

Typically, they are extremely lightweight and tend to be made from Ceramic or Titanium. By making use of five wheels and no brake, they allow for racers to get superfast movement thanks to the introduction of the carbon fiber making comfort easy to notice. 

The lower cuff also allows for less weight, meaning you can really ram up that speed along the way. The wheels are also usually very large in their diameter, giving racers better speed and greater acceleration than before. 

The frame reduces weight drastically and the style they are created in means that going quick with this is extremely simple -- this makes racing inline skating skates a particular style.

**Urban Skates**

Street or urban skates are relatively new on the block, but they offer a very particular style that is likely to capture the eye. They have become extremely popular for those who just want to travel the streets, not get into activities or for fitness. Typically, Urban skates are like a cross-breed between Recreational and Aggressive inline skate styles.

Similar to the Aggressive format in that they feel very powerful, they are built for longer journeys. The boot style allows for the pulling off of tricks and skills, whilst also making them comfortable for just skating down the road. 

The smart design in a hybrid manner allows for easy cornering and turning, as well as making sure that you can get the speed of larger wheels without the threat of poor cornering and turning. These also differ as they tend to have a brake which can be attached.
