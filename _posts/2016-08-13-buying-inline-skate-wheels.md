**Buying Inline Skate Wheels**

For many users of skates, you might notice how challenging it can be to find quality inline skate wheels. One of the most notable factors is that they have so many attributes; they come in various shapes, sizes and styles. Given the range of choices open to us, it helps to know what we need.

**What Matters?**

The first things that you want to take into account with skate wheels is the **size**, **hardness** (Durometer), **type** ad **shape**. These four critical elements will determine a lot about your wheels. If you fail to account for this, then you can run into the expensive error of buying the wrong type of wheel.

Not only will this limit your skating experience but it makes it likely you'll have to replace them right away. Other side considerations that might help you make the right choice includes the bearings, bearing spacing and hubs. 

**The Size Matters**

Inline skate wheels matter when it comes to the size -- they are measured in diameter and in millimeters, or mm. Typically, sizes will range from 57mm-100mm. the variance means that different skates will need different kinds of wheels. The general rule tends to be that the larger the wheel, the greater the speed. 

The smaller the wheels, though, the greater the acceleration/deceleration. If you aren't sure what is most suitable for your kind of inline skates, we recommend the following;

\*

For those using racing skates, you want to use larger wheels. This allows the smoothest ride, and also allows for strong levels of efficiency whilst you go. Typically, anything larger than 90mm will do the trick for you. They also rarely use breaks, using wider wheel bases and sometimes even five wheels over four to compensate for the break missing. 

\*

Those who are using inline skates for fitness, though, can relax a little. These tend to use larger wheels again but they tend to be much easier to find the kind of wheels needed as fitness skates are so specific.

\*

Hockey skates are very popular, are usually go for around 72-80mm in size. However, every manufacturer is different so it's best to make sure you do some research into the kinds of wheel configurations for each manufacturer before buying anything.

\*

Another common option is known as "aggressive" skates and they tend to need very high acceleration. Ergo, they use lesser wheels -- anything from 56-59mm tends to be the average for this kind.

\*

Recreational skates are the most common type found and they can go from 70-90mm depending on what you are dealing with. Smaller side wheels tend to be found on older skates, or beginner skates at this level. Make sure you stay smaller until you feel comfortable skating at faster speeds than normal.

**Durometer **

We mentioned earlier about the Durometer of a set of inline skates, and it is something you really don't want to mess around with. Typically, Durometer settings are managed by a number, followed by a capital letter -- usually an A. The higher the number, the harder the wheel. 68A tends to be the softest you should be going for as anything else will just rip up and wear down too quickly to be worth buying.

**The Shape**

Another major factor about your skating is going to be the shape. Wheel shape might not seem to be important on the face of it, but believe us when we say it's HUGELY important!

The profile of the wheel plays a major role in how comfortable -- or uncomfortable -- your experience will be. We recommend that you consider the following styles;

\*

For those who are going to be using speed skating wheels, look for very pointed appearances. This creates minimum rolling resistance, but they have much less grip as well. For advanced users.

\*

Inline hockey wheels are popular, too, and tend to be more rounded than normal. This allows for better contact for the skater, and also allows skaters to perform more turns at sharper inclines than usual.

\*

Recreational skating is obviously very popular, and is improved by using a standard elliptical profile with narrow centers and graduated edges. Allows for easy turning and acceleration -- a fine balance.

\*

Aggressive wheels tend to be quite tough to use, and usually are quite flat in terms of their profile -- more like a rounded rectangle, if that makes sense. They are usually good for jumps and tricks with a better surface and profile for landing.

**Skating Styles**

Of course, it's vital that you skate to the right style -- the shape is one thing, the style also maters however. To determine what kind of Durometer you need, for example, you should determine the kind of skating you intend to be using. 

\*

Softer wheels will be used on things like indoor rinks or skate rinks, whereas harder wheels will be used for those who need to absorb shock. 

\*

For those who are going to be using skating for fun or for fitness, consider using anything around the 78A range. This will give you plenty of flexibility and a strong combination between grip, and speed. If you will be skating outdoors only, try and go for anything from 82-84A. This offers better resistance but also increased speed, allowing you to hit rougher terrain easier.

\*

For those who will be managing their skates using inline hockey, be sure to look for anything from 72-74A. This will improve grip massively but also allow you to compensate for the surface that you will be using it on. 

\*

For more aggressive skating styles, start at 88A and work your way up depending on strength, terrain and various other factors. 

**Things to Consider**

Now that we understand and appreciate the basics, some other elements are likely to pop up that you need to consider making adjustments for. For example;

\*

Spacers are a major element of your skating experience and you should definitely take this into account. Every inline skate wheel makes use of two bearings and will have a nylon, plastic or aluminum spacer. For inline skating you should look at the aluminum settings as they tend to handle heat displacement better than the other choices.

\*

Another major element is your wheel cores -- the core of the wheel contains the hubs and the spokes, respectively. It's very similar to a car wheel, making use of the bearings and spacers to give it the best balance. Typically, the core is made from nylon or plastic and this keeps wheel weight down. The wheel core is determined by the wheels' purpose. For example, aggressive skaters will want a wheel that is made of solid plastic. However, those who intend to race mostly you will tend to have a plastic setting instead with more spokes included. The core design means having less rubber for a larger core, so those who tend to be using skates for speed will no doubt notice maintenance costs and times skyrocketing.

\*

One significant part of using good inline skates, though, comes from the frame capacity. Your wheels need to fit the frame capacity. If you purchase a wheel that is too large then it will not fit on the chassis, or the wheels will come together. The wheel size has to be the right fit -- you will have some leeway, but not much. Always try and stick to the same size of wheels that were included in manufacturing; these tend to be the optimal sizes to be used.
